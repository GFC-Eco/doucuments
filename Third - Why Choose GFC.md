# GFC documents
This document is a systematic description of the GFC project.
We are glad to present our design concept and product logic to you.
In the GFC project, we have thought deeply about many aspects.
Among them, a series of questions kept coming to our mind.

**What does the trust mean?**

In any economic activity, the trust is the cornerstone and one of the core elements of value.

**What embodies the trust?**

Behavior. All actions of people, good or bad, reflect the credibility of individuals and the degree of trust between people.

Therefore, the GFC project has designed a series of systems related to human behavior and social and economic aspects around 'the trust' to explore new values.
Please allow us to give you a brief introduction.

## Outline
**üéÅ Products - GFC DeFi: Liquidity & Star Trek 2077  & Trust Lending & Insurance**

# üåäLiquidity & Yield Aggregator

This is the first product of GFC ecology, similar to the mainstream liquidity mining project. 

But actually, we have deeper thoughts and some different ideas.

Let's focus on the system design of BTC network again.

**What is the core function of BTC?**

Mining and trading. Through the clever PoW consensus mechanism, the synergy between "miners" and "traders" is realized.

**What is the value of BTC?** 

Mining costs money, which is the basic value of BTC. 

The rest includes other behavioral and psychological perceptions needed to maintain the consensus, which is the compound value. 

As the number of user participation/following increases, the embedded value of BTC increases exponentially.

**What about the price of BTC?**

Value is somewhat correlated with price, but price will always include the degree of premium (either positive or negative). 

Therefore, the place where the BTC shines is the innovation of the core mechanism that gives the world something new.

One of the most interesting concepts is called decentralized/distributed bookkeeping.

Ten years later, DeFi has suddenly exploded. And its core mechanism has not left the concept.

DeFi stands for decentralized finance. 

DeFi is a cryptocurrency movement designed to offer traditional financial products and DeFi is a cryptocurrency movement designed to offer traditional financial products and services without the centralized authority of a bank, government or business. 

Based on DEX, coupled with liquidity mining to provide liquidity to one Token. The project is able to grow steadily.

This can be seen as the completely new phase of development compared to the centralized innovative models of previous years such as IXO.

It is important to note that this is not a set of models used to make huge profits, but essentially a moderate and benign way to invest in projects. 

When users value GFC, they can buy GFC Tokens, provide liquidity to GFC, and get multiple returns through GFC Stake.

GFC is more like a form of equity. By providing liquidity to the GFC ecosystem, you will be eligible for the right to receive dividends from all products in the GFC ecosystem. Users can fully understand the process of pledging liquidity as the act of equity investment.  

Each product has the proven business model. The user invests if they are positive, and withdraws if they are not.

It is completely free and secure.

Therefore, GFC Liquidity can also be considered as the GFC yield aggregator.

Unlike YFI's arbitrage model, GFC's revenue model includes not only the ongoing income generated through the Liquidity Farm. 

More important is the revenue generated by the series of products based on the behavior-credit evaluation system.

In the GFC business model, the specific revenue sources include the following (Rewards include).

* Galaxy.Finance interest 
* GFC token premium  
* GFC pool trading fees  
* GFC liquidation bonuses
* GFC.Trust-Leading service fees  
* GFC.Insurance service charge   
* Star Trek 2077 system fees  
* System dust (unassigned interest or fees)

# üí´Star Trek 2077
If GFC represents our aspiration to the universe and the future, Star Trek 2077 is the aircraft carrier that carries all users, and we will give users a certain contribution value for every contribution they make in the ecology. 

When the contribution value reaches a certain amount, you can become a more senior crew member and get a generous reward.

For the entire ecosystem, Star Trek2077 will become our user center and behavior-credit evaluation system. Users can receive exclusive rewards and assets from the GFC ecosystem. 

We encourage users to use GFC eco-products to a high degree or to actively build communities. Further, we will define these behaviors as the user profile of the user within the ecosystem - we trust your behavior more than any asset proof. 

Both our upcoming T.lending and subsequent products will be built on Star Trek2077 as the foundation for efficient demand processing.

Star Trek 2077 will consist of the following systems.

## Contribution Value System

Each positive action of users in the ecosystem will generate a certain amount of contribution value. 

When the contribution value reaches a certain level, you can become a higher level user (the highest level is 77) and will enjoy our generous rewards. 

After all, the fleet is dependent on the work of every crew member, and a good crew deserves more rewards.

As you can see, we have defined these actions that create value for the ecosystem. 

To make it easier for users to understand, we have set up a task center in our homepage. 

Actions that can generate contribution value are:

## Event Missions
Something interesting...
## Daily Missions
1) Sign in daily
2) Complete weekly sign-in
3) Retweet project articles

## Voyage Missions
1) Post original GFC related articles
2) Register an account successfully
3) Register successfully with the invitation code
4) A friend uses your invitation code to register successfully (repeat mission)
5) Complete the initial GFC pledge
6) Complete the initial LP-token pledge
7) Pledge GFC and get contribution value according to the quantity
8) Pledge LP-token and get contribution value according to the number of LP-tokens

Special Note: As we continue to update the version, and as the project continues to operate and improve its technical capabilities, we will continue to add user actions that are deemed to generate contribution value.

## Treasury Chest System

Crew members will get different quality treasure chests for free every time they complete specific tasks or contribute value upgrades, and they only need to spend a few GFC to buy keys to open the chests to get various rewards, up to 1 BTC!

The ways to get treasure chests include.

1. Contribution value upgrade rewards: users will automatically get a rare treasure chest for every level upgrade; a legendary treasure chest for every level upgrade 5; an epic treasure chest for every level upgrade 10

2. Specific invitation code redemption: when users register their personal accounts with specific invitation codes, they will get corresponding treasure chests

3. Mission reward: When completing specific missions (including daily missions, voyage missions and event missions), in addition to getting the corresponding contribution value, you will also get treasure chests of different qualities

The ways to get the keys include

1. Purchase with GFC (part of the revenue formed by the user‚Äôs purchase of the keys will be regularly collected and repurchased for destruction)

2. Completing specific tasks will be rewarded with additional keys in addition to the contribution value

3. When opening a treasure chest, there is a certain chance to get different quality of keys

## NFT - Ultimate Achievement Medal System
Each Ultimate Achievement Medal is a unique treasure in the universe and will be engraved in the Constellation public chain in the form of an NFT.

Only 100 Ultimate Achievement Medals will be awarded by the fleet, 60 of which will be given to the 60 highest contributors, 30 will be stored in epic quality treasure chests, and 10 will be awarded by the eco-community as eco-events.

Along with the medal, more eco rewards will be awarded within the community. 

And you can choose to give it back to the eco community after one year. Eco will buy back each Ultimate Achievement Medal for 5BTC. 

The buyback price will be 1BTC higher for each Ultimate Achievement medal held for one more year.
