# GFC documents
This document is a systematic description of the GFC project.
We are glad to present our design concept and product logic to you.
In the GFC project, we have thought deeply about many aspects.
Among them, a series of questions kept coming to our mind.

**What does the trust mean?**

In any economic activity, the trust is the cornerstone and one of the core elements of value.

**What embodies the trust?**

Behavior. All actions of people, good or bad, reflect the credibility of individuals and the degree of trust between people.

Therefore, the GFC project has designed a series of systems related to human behavior and social and economic aspects around 'the trust' to explore new values.
Please allow us to give you a brief introduction.

# What is the GFC?
Galaxy.Finance is the innovative blockchain financial product with "stranger trust network" as its underlying architecture.

It consists of four core functions: 

1. Behavior-credit evaluation system - Star Trek 2077

2. Unsecured credit lending platform - Trust Lending

3. Liquidity mining & revenue aggregator - GFC Liquidity Yield

4. AI credit insurance mechanism - GFC Insurance

These four systems are based on the core principle of â€˜trust without trustâ€™ and are transparent and fair through blockchain ( with smart contracts).   

Cause the code level, we ensure that no one can be the evil, so as to protect the asset security of the ecological users.  

Before elaborating the systems, we would like to illustrate the value (revenue) growth model of the ecology, in order to understand how important the system design is in a distrustful environment.

Infinite possibilities can be generated through just the right rules.  

It is also possible to guarantee the sustainability of the whole ecosystem and provide lucrative revenues for all ecological participants.  

The entire GFC ecosystem is a reward generating, arbitrage profit making machine!  

**Rewards include**:

* Galaxy.Finance interest 

* GFC token premium  

* GFC pool trading fees  

* GFC liquidation bonuses

* GFC.Trust-Leading service fees  

* GFC.Insurance service charge   

* Star Trek 2077 system fees  

* System dust (unassigned interest or fees)



# ðŸª™ Key System(Star Trek) - Strangers: Behavior-Trust-Model (BTM)

## What is the BTMï¼Ÿ

The BTM is a core model developed from many senior theories combined with innovative techniques in GFC.  

It is the complex model that references a variety of theories such as human behavior, psychology, behavioral finance, and economics.   

We try to explain the key information of the BTM in the simplest way.

The BTM is a top-down sequential design system consisting of three parts: the theoretical layer, the technical layer, and the application layer.  

Let's try to illustrate the theoretical layer first. 

As an example.

Suppose there is a company A, which is a normal profit-seeking company.  

According to the 'Marginal Analysis' principle of economics, Company A's products are priced according to the principle that 'marginal cost = marginal revenue'.

If this analysis is applied to hiring employees. 

Company A should keep hiring new employees until the cost of hiring an employee equals the value of the increase (in revenue) he brings.

In practice, however, this theoretically analysis turns out to be completely different from the reality.

In reality, Company A's criteria for hiring employees depends on the ability to sell the expected number of products - the increase or decrease in staff should be in line with the product sales expectations.

The emergence of a series of human behavioral phenomena that do not conform to traditional theoretical systems has prompted scientists to refocus their attention on 'people'. 

This is to observe the behavior of 'people' in order to find some different patterns.

In the meantime, renowned behavioral scientist Amos Tversky and psychologist Daniel Kahneman (2002 Nobel Laureate in Economics) have found some answers. 

Their research on heuristics and biases, as well as on prospect theory, clearly shows that people's behavior is not at all what rational economic models predict, but rather has a large bias.

The following graph, value function(Utility) curve shows that:
![](https://github.com/GFC-Eco/gfc-doucuments/blob/main/Photos/GFC-Value%20Curve.png?raw=true)

In addition, there are some basic human characteristics. 

For example, Weber-Fechner Law (people show decreasing sensitivity to changes in status quo), and Operant Conditioning (Skinner box), etc.

These behavioral theories will help us to better understand and design the behavioral ecosystem of GFC.

The more important impact remains in the field of behavioral economics.

The behavior of most people in today can be considered as economic behavior, and all choices or actions related to personal interests can be classified as 'beneficial', 'harmful', and 'equivalence'.

The power of â€˜Nudgeâ€™ can be achieved through the incentive guidance of 'beneficial' behavior, the avoidance and punishment of 'harmful' behavior, and the right of free choice of 'equivalence'.

## The Value of the Behavior

In this process, people's behaviors are real and have an impact on the surrounding environment, even to the future development.   

Therefore, the 'effective behaviors' are observed, collected, analyzed and organized to be able to form a behavioral portrait of the user.

This will be the very important part.

After theoretical analysis, we believe that effective behaviors can reflect a person's 'reputation' to some extent.

And effective behaviors with interactivity can reflect the 'trust' between individuals.

For example, Kevin and Elise are both friends of William, but they do not know each other.

Kevin is a person who has regular meals, keeps working out, studying and working in his daily life.  

William has informed Elise of this basic information.  

So Elise has known the basic knowledge of the stranger like Kevin, and these good behaviors can increase the level of trust between Kevin and Elise.

This is where the value of effective behavior lies. One's external performance is the collection of his inner self-requirement and fulfillment, as well as daily behavior.   

At the same time, external performance is also the reflection of one's credibility.

In the process of interacting with others, it further becomes a bridge of credit between two individuals.

In this example, William's role is primary and critical.

Only when he represents Kevin's daily performance in the objective way can he have a positive effect on Elise. 

Once William 'does evil', it directly affects the foundation of trust between two strangers.

In the GFC ecosystem, the BTM is the central bridge.

Through the Star Trek 2077 behavioral credit assessment system, we record and evaluate the effective behaviors of users, and then, build a basic credit profile for each eco-user. 

This will result in more enriching behaviors. For example, the value-added services of Trust Lending, Insurance, Liquidity and other functions.

## Technical Layer

The value of theory is to guide the direction of thinking and implementation, and to provide sufficient reason and motivation to keep thinking and innovating.

The value of the technical layer is the physical basis.

The Bitcoin network and the Etherium can be considered as the Blockchain 1.0 era and Blockchain 2.0 era, respectively. 

One of the significant differences is the presence of smart contracts.

Although there are many vulnerabilities and risks associated with smart contracts, they are also an irreversible technological innovation. 

Through a series of smart contracts, it is possible to successfully build an ecosystem that is entirely built with the participation of strangers.

In this ecosystem, the full trust relationship (distrustful trust) is created between strangers and strangers.

For this reason, GFC could theoretically fit seamlessly on any public-chain with the smart contract layer. Etherium network or otherwise.

However, in the initial stage, we still choose the most mature and ecologically sound public-chain. 

Etherium, as the official option.

It is worth mentioning that we are still considering a cross-public chain ecosystem in addition to the Etherium.

To this end, we are also working on a public chain for GFC, codenamed Constellation.C.

Constellation.C will have all the elements of a mature public-chain, with the following key features.

1. Good support for NFT with high-speed transaction structure.

2. The ability to store custom forms of block data structures.

3. Basic cross-chain transaction mechanism (automatic acceptor mechanism).

4. PoM consensus and eco-democratic governance.

5. Smart contract system that supports iterable updates.

Constellation.C is expected to go live at the end of Q2, 2021.

At that time, it will integrate the existing Erc-GFC ecology with the C.C ecology. 

And the interaction result will be completely imperceptible to users.

## Application layer

The application layer mainly contains the user-perceivable front-end interactive interface and the back-end functional support.

GFC is strictly a decentralized credit finance ecosystem.

GFC is rooted in innovative financial application products to realize users' investment income behavior and effectively reduce their risks.

To this end, we use Star Trek 2077 as a credit building system to realize product forms with different attributes such as liquidity arbitrage - yield aggregator, unsecured credit lending, and AI credit insurance mechanism.

GFC is able to provide a rich portfolio of investment targets for users with different risk appetite to effectively hedge risks and obtain expected returns.

Specific product descriptions are detailed in subsequent chapters.



# What is the value of GFC Token?

GFC Token represents the right to earnings, credit value and ecological governance rights.

This is reflected in.

## GFC Token's Right to Earnings

GFC Token is a bearer, tradable certificate of income rights. 

The default unit of GFC Token is 1 GFC, but it can still be split evenly to four decimal places.

The underlying value of the GFC Token is derived from the value of the entire ecosystem. 

All functions and fund flows in the ecology need to use GFC. All the management fees, service fees, and other fees will be used as the value point of GFC. 

All system or additional revenue will be used to buy back GFC to increase the base value of GFC. 

When necessary, the system will automatically destroy a certain amount of GFCs to reduce the total amount of GFC Token and increase the base value of a single GFC Token.

GFC Token is circulated among various products in the ecosystem.

Each time a cycle is completed, some base value is added. 

The base value is related to the external resources absorbed by the ecology, the speed of transaction flow, and the systematic and non-systematic risk values.

It is important to highlight that GFC's revenue sources include various products such as T.Lending, Insurance, Star Trek, Liquidity, etc. 

More products will come soon in the continued development.

The value-added revenue generated by all products will be reflected in the value of GFC Token as well as the price.

## Credit Record Equity of GFC Token

In the GFC ecology, there exists a credit record credential, GFV, which is the sum of the contribution value of the GFC ecology, namely, the sum of the value generated by the user's credit behavior.

Users receive various types of rewards in Star Trek 2077, including **Contribution Value**, **GFV**, **CC-NFT** and **GFC Token** (or BTC, ETH).

Among them, GFV is the means of rewarding users for creditable (valid) behavior. At the same time, GFV is also where the value added of GFC dividend rewards lies. 

When harvesting GFC dividend rewards, users can mix cGFC and GFV in a fixed ratio to get an additional 10-30% yield bonus.

At this point, the credit equity value of GFC is completed embedded.

## GFC Token's Eco-Governance Rights
As the decentralized platform, the most important feature is that the governance rights are decentralized rather than concentrated in the specific hub. 

In the GFC ecosystem, all users and nodes enjoy the common standard of rights.

For this purpose, we have studied the history and referred to several mainstream political management systems. 

Without considering the hereditary king system, they can be broadly divided into three categories: democratic voting system, constitutional monarchy and democratic centralism. 

The rights granted to citizens vary from system to system.

Apart from the general uniformity of the rights of citizens, there is a huge difference in the actual right to participate in politics and to enjoy additional benefits - which is the essence of the term, privilege.

In any sovereign subject, the ultimate right returns to a particular collective. Over time, the rights of this collective will outweigh those of others in the subject, creating the centralized center of rights.

If we use the concept of the computer, the centralized center is the â€˜super administratorâ€™ with respect to each node. 

The other nodes derive some of their power from the centralized power nodes, and there is the right of giving and the right of taking back.

In a decentralized ecosystem, all nodes have the same governance rights. Key proposals are judged and voted on by all individual nodes within the ecology. 

Every node user has the right and obligation to govern.

Please make sure to be clear on this point. Participation in governance is not only a right, but also an obligation.

In the process of ecological development, there will be many choices that require voting by all users.

In accordance with the principles of fairness and materialism, each GFC equals one vote and each GFV equals 0.2 votes. 

Therefore, the total number of GFC corresponds to 22 million votes, while the number of GFV grows as the number of users increases and grows. 

But it will always conform to one criterion: the more you give, the more you get.

In the future, all proposals in the ecology will require the participation of users.

The only way to be considered valid is to exceed a certain percentage of the number of votes. 


As you konw,

**The Code is the law.**

**The behavior is the trust.**
