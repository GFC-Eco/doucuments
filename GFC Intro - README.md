# GFC documents
This document is a systematic description of the GFC project.
We are glad to present our design concept and product logic to you.
In the GFC project, we have thought deeply about many aspects.
Among them, a series of questions kept coming to our mind.

**What does the trust mean?**

In any economic activity, the trust is the cornerstone and one of the core elements of value.

**What embodies the trust?**

Behavior. All actions of people, good or bad, reflect the credibility of individuals and the degree of trust between people.

Therefore, the GFC project has designed a series of systems related to human behavior and social and economic aspects around 'the trust' to explore new values.
Please allow us to give you a brief introduction.
