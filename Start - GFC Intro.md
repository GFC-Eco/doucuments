# GFC documents
This document is a systematic description of the GFC project.
We are glad to present our design concept and product logic to you.
In the GFC project, we have thought deeply about many aspects.
Among them, a series of questions kept coming to our mind.

**What does the trust mean?**

In any economic activity, the trust is the cornerstone and one of the core elements of value.

**What embodies the trust?**

Behavior. All actions of people, good or bad, reflect the credibility of individuals and the degree of trust between people.

Therefore, the GFC project has designed a series of systems related to human behavior and social and economic aspects around 'the trust' to explore new values.
Please allow us to give you a brief introduction.

# ONE: GFC Intro - Cherish your Trust
Galaxy.FinanceÔºàGFCÔºâis a **DeFi ecosystem by using Behavior (of strangers) - Trust - Model and blockchain technology**.
GFC is based on the theoretical system of human behavior, economics and game theory.
And we trust in the two principles:

   **1. The Code is the law.**

   **2. The behavior is the trust.**

Let's imagine.

Suppose we are on Noah's ark, heading for the stars. Every planet (except the stars) is silent.

To us, each planet is unfamiliar.

People are wary of unfamiliar things and feel insecure. This feeling of insecurity, in turn, inspires individuals to distrust others.

In the Age of Sail, how cruel and hostile were the policies of the explorers' countries toward the natives of the New World, in some corners of the Earth, and even more so when traveling in the universe.

Want to trust a stranger, or a group of strangers, is an incredible thing.

However, with the support of modern technology and related theories, we can somehow achieve stranger trust - this is actually a very important technological innovation and breakthrough.

Of course, the establishment of stranger trust requires not only consensus and rules, but also the common force to maintain the rules.

For example, if more than 51% of BTC participants chose to defect, the whole history would be rewritten. 

To prevent that, Satoshi has devised a series of subtle tricks to defuse or transfer these risks.

Here is an interesting question: How is it that the simple rules devised by Satoshi have such great power of influence? Why do most people follow the rules of the game that were developed a decade ago? Are so many people around the world altruistic?

The essence is not that Satoshi is God, but that he has cleverly used some forces of nature. 

This force is the power of truth in economics, behavior science, sociology, psychology and many other disciplines. Through a series of clever designs, to drive the selfish people, spontaneous implementation of the rules, so as to achieve the stability and development of the entire network.

This is really a genius design.

GFC follows the core principles of Bitcoin, focusing on the construction and application of stranger trust network.

GFC-Defi is an interesting experiment.

# TWO: What does GFC meanÔºü

I would like to briefly describe the value and significance of GFC.

The core value of GFC lies in the exploration and application of the solution of stranger-trust-mechanism, which is to solve the problem of trust among distrustful subjects. 

GFC builds an evolving ecosystem of stranger relationships through blockchain technology and economics applications.

The GFC ecosystem uses economic and financial behavior as a medium and incentives as a means to guide the ecological users to collaborate and divide the works. And then we can create the better ecological future together.

Each participant will also be rewarded.

To better understand this description, we try to tell you a story with some questions and answers.

What is the law of the jungle? The superior is the inferior.

A cheetah is more powerful than a deer, so the cheetah is always the predator and the deer is the prey.

A single cheetah has difficulty dealing with a pack of hyenas, so often the latter gets the prey that the cheetah preys on.

Within the framework of the jungle, the stronger the safer. There is no equality and trust. 

Even for individuals within the same group, mutual trust is very fragile. Much less in the face of strange animals.

What is the law in human society? It's worth thinking about ü§î.


With the development and evolution of living things, primates with stronger thinking ability and the spirit of all things, human beings, were gradually formed. 
Due to the emergence of language and writing, the communication of ideas was facilitated. 

As tools were created and continuously developed, the awareness and result of collaborative division of labor to win together emerged. It was only after long years of learning. The word, trust, took on its true meaning.

Trust, is an abstract concept and emotional feeling based on a specific familiarity and security, as well as on the perception of others.

Trust, also implies the existence of situations of mistrust. This is the limitation of trust.

Trust, in its most intuitive form, is a manifestation of the sense of security for familiar relatives and friends. It can also be extended to trust in a group, a region, a religion, or even a country. 

But all of these imply that one must have a certain knowledge of the object of trust, and a sufficient sense of security and familiarity. And trust is difficult to form directly, instead of the degree of trust decreases gradually as the number of transmission nodes increases.

When trust does not exist in human society, the pattern of cooperation and division of labor will be directly broken, and the law of human society will be no different from the law of the jungle.

**Since trust is so important, can we break its limitations and make it play a more significant role and value?**

If we look at the universe, the trust between humans and aliens, and the trust between planets... without any pavement, how to achieve a cooperative division of labor, collaboration and win-win trust model?

In other words, how to form trust between strangers?

This is the key issue that GFC focuses on, and where the value of GFC lies.


We have always considered the emergence of Bitcoin to be an irreversible and groundbreaking convergence of innovative technologies. Satoshi has implemented the 'trust mechanism without trust' through ingenious design.

Imagine how many BTC holders around the world are familiar with each other and know each other? How many people bought BTC because they were introduced by their friends? 

Most of the BTC holders don't know each other, but they trust each other because of a set of theoretical rules and underlying technology of Bitcoin, which can be interpreted as a consensus between multiple parties.

What BTC solves is not a monetary or economic problem, but essentially an exploration of the trust mechanism of strangers.

However, due to the limitations of the technology or the scenario, the Bitcoin network is more like a demo, showing people the glimpse of the future.
The value of the BTC is increasingly reflected as a commodity value.

According to the defined rules, there is only the function of trading or storing BTC in the Bitcoin network.

This decade has seen numerous attempts to use blockchain as the underlying technology for applications, but most of them are flashy stories that do not jump out of the basic rules and established scenarios.

For this reason, we would like to try something different in the current phase.

With the core concept of ‚ÄòStranger's Behavior is the trust‚Äô, GFC has created an experimental behavioral finance project that can be continuously updated.

It is worth re-emphasizing that GFC is a product with financial investment/arbitrage as the economic incentive system, the behavioral-credit system with the BTM model. And the set of ‚Äòbehavioral finance ecosystem‚Äô with yield aggregator, trust lending and credit insurance as the functional system.

Therefore, GFC has two important features.

1. In the GFC ecosystem, users' contributions can be converted into economic rewards and can accumulate personal reputation, which is the value.
2. The economic design of GFC has a sound business model, and can bring users sufficient and safe investment income.

**Credit is the most critical value.**
